  <feedbackcor>Good job! You correctly identified the type of inference used in each statement.</feedbackcor>
  <feedbackincor>Incorrect. Arguments that use past observations to predict the future or theorize beyond the evidence given are inductive. Arguments that use a conditional and do not refer to probability in the premise or conclusion are deductive. Arguments that list evidence and then conclude with a proposition that would explain the truth of the evidence are abductive.</feedbackincor>
